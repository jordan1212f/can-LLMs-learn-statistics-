A two-sample z-test is appropriate here because we are comparing the means of two independent groups (hybrid and non-hybrid sedans).\n\n3.

If the null value (0) lies outside this range, we would reject H0 at a 5% level of significance.\n\n4. One possible source of bias in the data collection that could affect the conclusion is if the samples are not randomly selected. For instance, if the hybrid sedans tested are all high-end models with better fuel efficiency, while the non-hybrid sedans are mostly economy models, this could skew the results towards finding a significant difference that may not exist in the broader population.\n\nPart B)\n\n{\n  \"id\": null,\n  \"H0\": \"The mean miles-per-gallon (mpg) of hybrid sedans is equal to the mean mpg of non-hybrid sedans\",\n  \"Ha\": \"The mean mpg of hybrid sedans is greater than the mean mpg of non-hybrid sedans\",\n  \"variable\": \"mean mpg difference between hybrid and non-hybrid sedans\",\n  \"test\": \"Two-sample z-test\",\n  \"df\": \"(n1 - 1)(n2 - 1)/((n1 + n2 - 2)\",\n  \"alpha\": 0.05,\n  \"stat_name\": \"z-statistic\",\n  \"stat_value\": \"Not calculated (full calculation not performed)\",\n  \"p_value\": \"Not calculated (full calculation not performed)\",\n  \"decision\": \"Not determined (full calculation not performed)\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"Not determined (full calculation not performed)\",\n  \"ci_transfer_used\": false,\n", "answer_json": null, "retrieved": [{"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_introstatistics.pdf", "page": 23}, {"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_introstatistics.pdf", "page": 43}, {"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_statsthinking.pdf", "page": 2}, {"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_introstatistics.pdf", "page": 41}, {"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_introstatistics.pdf", "page": 19}, {"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_introstatistics.pdf", "page": 31}, {"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_introstatistics.pdf", "page": 50}, {"source": "/content/ht_pdfs/HT_introstatistics.pdf", "page": 17}]}
