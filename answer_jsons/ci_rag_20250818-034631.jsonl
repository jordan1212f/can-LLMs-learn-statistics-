The experiment setup would involve a random selection of 50 users, divided into two groups: a treatment group that uses the meditation app and a control group that does not use the app. Both groups would maintain similar demographic characteristics and sleep habits to minimize confounding variables.\n\n2. The main metric to quantify sleep quality would be the average total sleep time (TST) measured over a consistent period, such as a week or a month.\n\n3. Null Hypothesis (H0): The median TST for the treatment group is equal to the median TST for the control group, i.e., \u03bc_app - \u03bc_control = 0.\n   Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The median TST for the treatment group is greater than the median TST for the control group, i.e., \u03bc_app - \u03bc_control > 0.\n\n4. A 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two group means represents the range within which we can be 95% confident that the true difference between the population means falls. Rejecting H0 at level \u03b1 (alpha) if the null value lies outside the (1-\u03b1) CI.\n\n5. To provide sufficient evidence that the app improves sleep quality, the confidence interval would need to exclude the value zero and have a positive upper limit. For example, if the 95% CI is (X, Y), where X < 0 and Y > 0, then we can conclude that the app improves sleep quality.\n\nPart B)\n{\n  \"id\": null,\n  \"H0\": \"The median TST for the treatment group is equal to the median TST for the control group\",\n  \"Ha\": \"The median TST for the treatment group is greater than the median TST for the control group\",\n  \"variable\": \"Total Sleep Time (TST)\",\n  \"test\": \"Two-sample t-test\",\n  \"df\": \"Assuming normal distributions and equal variances, the degrees of freedom would be approximately 48 (49 - 2)\",\n  \"alpha\": \"0.05\",\n  \"stat_name\": \"t-statistic\",\n  \"stat_value\": \"T-value", "answer_json": null, "retrieved": [{"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/inferenceskills.pdf", "page": 54}, {"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/ActualCI_Openintro.pdf", "page": 10}, {"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/CI_IntroToStats.pdf", "page": 14}, {"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/inferenceskills.pdf", "page": 24}, {"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/ci_openintro.pdf", "page": 19}, {"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/MIT_CisolutionsExam.pdf", "page": 2}, {"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/inferenceskills.pdf", "page": 36}, {"source": "/content/ci_pdfs/ci_openintro.pdf", "page": 21}]}
