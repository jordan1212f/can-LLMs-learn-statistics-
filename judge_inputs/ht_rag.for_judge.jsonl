After spending a predetermined amount of time studying, each student will then be tested on a set of questions related to the material they studied. The scores from these tests will serve as our measure of memory recall.\n\n3. Independent Variable: Study Environment (Silent Library vs Noisy Cafe)\n   Dependent Variable: Memory Recall Score\n\n4. Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in memory recall scores between studying in the silent study areas of Laidlaw library and studying in the noisier cafe part.\n   Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Studying in the silent study areas of Laidlaw library leads to higher memory recall compared to studying in the noisier cafe part.\n\n5. Using a confidence interval from the collected data, we can support or refute our hypothesis by comparing the mean memory recall score from the silent study area to the mean memory recall score from the noisy cafe area. If the 95% confidence interval for the silent study area does not include the mean memory recall score from the noisy cafe area, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that studying in the silent study areas of Laidlaw library leads to higher memory recall compared to studying in the noisier cafe part."}

The experiment setup would involve a controlled study, with one treatment group using the meditation app and a control group not using the app. Both groups would be comparable in terms of demographics, lifestyle habits, etc. to ensure any differences in sleep quality are due to the app.\n\n2. The main metric to measure sleep quality could be the average hours of deep sleep per night, as measured by a reliable sleep tracking device.\n\n3. Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the mean hours of deep sleep between the group using the meditation app (μ_app) and the control group (μ_control). In mathematical terms, H0: μ_app - μ_control = 0.\n   Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The meditation app improves sleep quality, resulting in a higher mean hours of deep sleep for the app group compared to the control group. In mathematical terms, Ha: μ_app - μ_control > 0.\n\n4.
