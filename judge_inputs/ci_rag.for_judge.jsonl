Describe the experiment setup, including the treatment and control groups.\n2. State the main metric you would measure to quantify sleep quality.\n3. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses in the context of the difference between the two group means (mu_app - mu_control).\n4.

The experiment setup would involve a random selection of 50 users, divided into two groups: a treatment group that uses the meditation app and a control group that does not use the app. Both groups would maintain similar demographic characteristics and sleep habits to minimize confounding variables.\n\n2. The main metric to quantify sleep quality would be the average total sleep time (TST) measured over a consistent period, such as a week or a month.\n\n3. Null Hypothesis (H0): The median TST for the treatment group is equal to the median TST for the control group, i.e., μ_app - μ_control = 0.\n   Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The median TST for the treatment group is greater than the median TST for the control group, i.e., μ_app - μ_control > 0.\n\n4. A 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two group means represents the range within which we can be 95% confident that the true difference between the population means falls. Rejecting H0 at level α (alpha) if the null value lies outside the (1-α) CI.\n\n5. To provide sufficient evidence that the app improves sleep quality, the confidence interval would need to exclude the value zero and have a positive upper limit. For example, if the 95% CI is (X, Y), where X < 0 and Y > 0, then we can conclude that the app improves sleep quality."}
