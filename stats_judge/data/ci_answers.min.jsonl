{"question_id": "os_5.19c", "answer_text": "Part A)\n\n1. The width of a 90% confidence interval is generally wider compared to a 95% confidence interval from the same data.

No, the researcher's claim of 70% would not be supported by a 90% confidence interval.\n\n3. Since the 95% confidence interval [0.54, 0.64] does not include the claimed value of 70%, we cannot accept the researcher's claim at the 90% confidence level. This is because our confidence intervals are constructed such that we reject the null hypothesis (H0: true proportion equals the claimed value) if the null value lies outside the confidence interval.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The smoking rate among NYC adults has not changed.\n   Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The smoking rate among NYC adults has decreased.\n\n2. The statistical test to use is a One-Sample Z-Test for a Proportion. This test is used when testing whether a sample proportion differs significantly from a known population proportion.\n\n3. To compute a confidence interval for the proportion, we will use the Wilson Score Interval. This interval is appropriate when the sample size is small (n < 30) and the population proportion is unknown. The Wilson Score Interval provides a more accurate estimate compared to the traditional method of adding and subtracting 1.96 from the sample proportion.\n\n4. Sample size affects our ability to detect a decrease in smoking rates positively. A larger sample size increases the precision of our estimate and makes it easier to detect changes in the smoking rate."}

A small p-value suggests that the observed difference is unlikely to occur by chance alone, providing evidence against the null hypothesis.
