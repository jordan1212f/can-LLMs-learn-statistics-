This means that we might conclude that the food is safe when it is not, leading to potential health risks for diners. On the other hand, the Type I error involves rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, which may lead to unnecessary actions such as closing a restaurant unnecessarily.

{"question_id": "is_98", "answer_text": "Part A)\n\n1. H0: p ≥ 0.4\n   Ha: p < 0.4\n\n2. This is a test of two population proportions since we are comparing two independent groups (schoolmates and the percentage fearing public speaking). We choose this test because our sample size is reasonably large (n > 30 for each group), and the assumption of normality can be approximated due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n3. To reject H0 using a p-value approach, we compare the calculated p-value to the significance level (α). If p-value < α, we reject H0. For a confidence interval approach, we calculate a confidence interval for the population proportion p. If the null value (0.4) falls outside the confidence interval, we reject H0.\n\n4. A potential limitation of this study is selection bias. If the student selectively chooses certain individuals to survey (for example, only asking friends or those known to fear public speaking), the results may not accurately represent the entire school population."}
{"question_id": "is_100", "answer_text": "Part A)\n\n1. Scenario: The recent NYC Health Survey reports a 12% adult smoking rate. You survey 70 NYC residents and find that 9 smoke.\n\n   a) Null Hypothesis (H0): The smoking rate among NYC residents is 12%.\n      Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The smoking rate among NYC residents is NOT 12%.\n\n   b) This scenario involves testing a single proportion, as we are comparing the smoking rate found in our sample to the reported rate from the NYC Health Survey. We will use a one-sample z-test since our sample size is large enough (n > 30) and the success-failure condition is satisfied (np > 10 and n(1 - p) > 10).\n\n   c) To compute a confidence interval for the proportion, we can use the formula for a binomial proportion:\n      98% Confidence Interval for p:\n      p ± z*√[(p*(1-p)/n], where p = 9/70, n = 70, and z = 1.96 (for a 95% confidence level).\n      Solving for the interval gives us (0.071, 0.169).\n      If the null value (0.12) lies outside this interval, we would reject H0 at the 5% level of significance.\n\n   d) The sample size affects our ability to detect a decrease in smoking rates positively. A larger sample size provides a more precise estimate of the population proportion and increases our power to reject H0 if it is false."}

H0: μ\\_ME = μ\\_EE (Null hypothesis: the means of starting salaries for mechanical engineering (ME) and electrical engineering (EE) graduates are equal.)\n   Ha: μ\\_ME < μ\\_EE (Alternative hypothesis: the mean starting salary for mechanical engineering graduates is lower than that for electrical engineering graduates.)\n\n2. Since both populations have unknown standard deviations, an unpooled t-test is more appropriate because it allows for unequal variances. This is due to the presence of different SDs for the ME and EE groups.\n\n3. A 95% CI for the difference in means would indicate the range within which we are 95% confident that the true difference in means falls. Rejecting H0 at level α (alpha) if the null value lies outside the (1−α) CI: if the 95% CI does not include zero, we would reject H0 and conclude that the means are significantly different.\n\n4. One factor that could influence the conclusion is the assumption of normality. If the distributions of the starting salaries for both groups are not approximately normal, the t-test may not be valid. Additionally, a small sample size could also affect the validity of the conclusions drawn from the test."}

Ha: μB - μG > 0 (The mean annual cost for insuring teenage boys is higher than the mean annual cost for insuring teenage girls.)\n3. This is a test of two means because we are comparing the means of two independent groups (boys and girls).\n4. We will use a two-sample t-test since the population standard deviations are unknown.\n5. Interpreting the p-value: If the null hypothesis is true, there is a low probability (p-value) that we would observe a sample difference as extreme as the one we observed if the true difference between the means is zero.\n6. Interpreting a 95% CI for the mean cost difference: We can construct a 95% CI for the difference in means. If the null value (0) falls outside this interval, we reject H0 at the 5% level. Conversely, if the null value is within the interval, we fail to reject H0."}
{"question_id": "is_2s96", "answer_text": "Part A)\n\n1. Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean miles-per-gallon (mpg) of hybrid sedans is equal to the mean mpg of non-hybrid sedans.\n   Ha: The mean mpg of hybrid sedans is greater than the mean mpg of non-hybrid sedans.\n\n2. A two-sample z-test is appropriate here because we are comparing the means of two independent groups (hybrid and non-hybrid sedans).\n\n3. Interpreting a 95% confidence interval for the mpg difference means that we can be 95% certain that the true difference between the means falls within the specified range. If the null value (0) lies outside this range, we would reject H0 at a 5% level of significance.\n\n4. One possible source of bias in the data collection that could affect the conclusion is if the samples are not randomly selected. For instance, if the hybrid sedans tested are all high-end models with better fuel efficiency, while the non-hybrid sedans are mostly economy models, this could skew the results towards finding a significant difference that may not exist in the broader population."}
{"question_id": "selfmade_1", "answer_text": "Part A)\n\n1. Primary Research Question: Does studying in the silent study areas of Laidlaw library lead to higher memory recall compared to studying in the noisier cafe part?\n\n2. Data Collection: To collect memory recall data, we can design a controlled experiment where 60 university students are randomly assigned to either the silent study area or the noisy cafe area. After spending a predetermined amount of time studying, each student will then be tested on a set of questions related to the material they studied. The scores from these tests will serve as our measure of memory recall.\n\n3. Independent Variable: Study Environment (Silent Library vs Noisy Cafe)\n   Dependent Variable: Memory Recall Score\n\n4. Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in memory recall scores between studying in the silent study areas of Laidlaw library and studying in the noisier cafe part.\n   Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Studying in the silent study areas of Laidlaw library leads to higher memory recall compared to studying in the noisier cafe part.\n\n5. Using a confidence interval from the collected data, we can support or refute our hypothesis by comparing the mean memory recall score from the silent study area to the mean memory recall score from the noisy cafe area. If the 95% confidence interval for the silent study area does not include the mean memory recall score from the noisy cafe area, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that studying in the silent study areas of Laidlaw library leads to higher memory recall compared to studying in the noisier cafe part."}
{"question_id": "selfmade_2", "answer_text": "Part A)\n\n1. The experiment setup would involve a controlled study, with one treatment group using the meditation app and a control group not using the app. Both groups would be comparable in terms of demographics, lifestyle habits, etc. to ensure any differences in sleep quality are due to the app.\n\n2. The main metric to measure sleep quality could be the average hours of deep sleep per night, as measured by a reliable sleep tracking device.\n\n3. Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the mean hours of deep sleep between the group using the meditation app (μ_app) and the control group (μ_control). In mathematical terms, H0: μ_app - μ_control = 0.\n   Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The meditation app improves sleep quality, resulting in a higher mean hours of deep sleep for the app group compared to the control group. In mathematical terms, Ha: μ_app - μ_control > 0.\n\n4. A 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two group means would represent the range within which we are 95% confident that the true difference between the two population means lies.\n\n5. To provide sufficient evidence that the app improves sleep quality, the confidence interval would need to lie entirely above the zero line, indicating that the difference between the two group means is statistically significantly greater than zero."}
