However, independence doesn’t seem unreasonable, since the individuals in each job mare different from each other.

Because we observe that men are paid more in a higher proportion of cases and we have rejected H0, we can conclude that men are being paid higher amounts in ways not explainable by chance alone.","Full Test Procedure","Gender pay gap in medicine.
