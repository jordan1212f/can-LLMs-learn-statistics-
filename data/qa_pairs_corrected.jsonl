(b) Do you think the confidence interval is still valid for the opinions of New Yorkers today? 8(a) If we took many such samples and computed a 95% confidence interval for each, then about 95% of those intervals would contain the actual proportion of New York adults who supported a quarantine for anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola patient. (b) Not necessarily. The poll was taken at a time where there was a huge public safety concern. Now that people have had some time to step back, they may have changed their opinions. We would need to run a new poll if we wanted to get an estimate of the current proportion of New York adults who would support such a quarantine period.", "response": "186 CHAPTER 5.

{"instruction": "EXAMPLE 5.21 Explain why we cannot conclude that college-educated adults simply guessed on the infant vaccina- tion question. While we failed to reject H0, that does not necessarily mean the null hypothesis is true. Perhaps there was an actual difference, but we were not able to detect it with the relatively small sample of 50. DOUBLE NEGATIVES CAN SOMETIMES BE USED IN STATISTICS In many statistical explanations, we use double negatives. For instance, we might say that the null hypothesis is not implausible or we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Double negatives are used to communicate that while we are not rejecting a position, we are also not saying it is correct. 16Arguably this method is slightly imprecise. As we’ll see in a few pages, the standard error is often computed slightly differently in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion.", "response": "192 CHAPTER 5. FOUNDATIONS FOR INFERENCE GUIDED PRACTICE 5.22 Let’s move onto a second question posed by the Roslings: There are 2 billion children in the world today aged 0-15 years old, how many children will there be in year 2100 according to the United Nations? a. 4 billion. b. 3 billion. c. 2 billion. Set up appropriate hypotheses to evaluate whether college-educated adults are better than random guessing on this question. Also, see if you can guess the correct answer before checking the answer in the footnote!17 GUIDED PRACTICE 5.23 This time we took a larger sample of 228 college-educated adults, 34 (14.9%) selected the correct answer to the question in Guided Practice 5.22: 2 billion.

{"instruction": "EXAMPLE 5.38 Why can’t we simply run a one-sided test that goes in the direction of the data? We’ve been building a careful framework that controls for the Type 1 Error, which is the significance level α in a hypothesis test. We’ll use the α = 0.05 below to keep things simple. Imagine we could pick the one-sided test after we saw the data. What will go wrong? • If ˆp is smaller than the null value, then a one-sided test where p < p0 would mean that any observation in the lower 5% tail of the null distribution would lead to us rejecting H0. • If ˆp is larger than the null value, then a one-sided test where p > p0 would mean that any observation in the upper 5% tail of the null distribution would lead to us rejecting H0. Then if H0 were true, there’s a 10% chance of being in one of the two tails, so our testing error is actually α = 0.10, not 0.05. That is, not being careful about when to use one-sided tests effectively undermines the methods we’re working so hard to develop and utilize.", "response": "202 CHAPTER 5.

{"instruction": "EXAMPLE 7.40 College departments commonly run multiple lectures of the same introductory course each semester because of high demand. Consider a statistics department that runs three lectures of an introductory statistics course. We might like to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in first exam scores in these three classes (A, B, and C). Describe appropriate hypotheses to determine whether there are any differences between the three classes. The hypotheses may be written in the following form: H0: The average score is identical in all lectures. Any observed difference is due to chance. Nota- tionally, we write µA = µB = µC. HA: The average score varies by class. We would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis if there were larger differences among the class averages than what we might expect from chance alone. Strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis in ANOVA is described by unusually large differences among the group means. We will soon learn that assessing the variability of the group means relative to the variability among individual observations within each group is key to ANOVA’s success.", "response": "286 CHAPTER 7.
