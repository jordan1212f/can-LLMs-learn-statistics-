MARKING RULES — FOLLOW STRICTLY

1) CATEGORY RESOLUTION
- If {{category}} exists in the marking rubric, use that checklist.
- Else, resolve via the aliases.
- If still unresolved, return the error JSON (see schema) with error="Unknown category".

2) SCOPE
- Evaluate ONLY what appears in the MODEL'S ANSWER.
- If the answer has “Part A” and “Part B”, GRADE **Part A only**. Ignore any JSON or metadata in Part B.
- Accept equivalent math symbols (e.g., ≠ and !=, ≤ and <=).
- Use the gold answer only to verify content expressly required by the checklist (e.g., the correct null value), not to autofill missing steps.

3) SUBSCORES (three dimensions: Correctness, completeness and clarity)
- Award three subscores (max from weights):
  • correctness ∈ [0, {{weights.correctness}}]
  • completeness ∈ [0, {{weights.completeness}}]
  • clarity ∈ [0, {{weights.clarity}}]
- For EACH checklist section (correctness / completeness / clarity):
  • For each bullet, mark: met = 1, partially met = 0.5, not met = 0.
  • Exclude any N/A bullets from the denominator and note them in the rationale.
  • Subscore = (sum of points across applicable bullets ÷ number of applicable bullets) × section_weight.
  • Do NOT round during scoring.

4) DEDUCTIONS (apply AFTER subscores)
- Select only codes from the global list that clearly apply; give a one-line reason (≤100 chars) for each.
- Apply ONLY deduction codes listed in `deduction_applicability_codes` for the resolved category.
- Do NOT assign points; a downstream scorer maps codes to points, enforces per_deduction_max and deduction_cap_fraction, and clamps to [0,10].
- Use ONLY deduction codes listed under applicable_deductions. If a code is not in that list, DO NOT output it.
- Do NOT double-flag the same underlying mistake with multiple codes unless they are distinct; if distinct, note why briefly.
- Do NOT apply `null_missing_equality` if H0 includes any equality form (words or symbols).
- Use `arithmetic_error_major/minor` ONLY when a numeric computation is shown AND is incorrect.
- Use the CI boundary rule ONLY if the null equals a CI bound; otherwise do not mention it.

5) CONVENTIONS & DEFAULTS
- CI↔α linkage: two-sided test at α corresponds to a (1−α) CI.
- Boundary: for two-sided tests, if the null value equals a CI bound, treat as NOT rejected.
- If α is not stated, assume α = 0.05.
- Don’t penalize formatting/typos unless they block understanding (affects clarity only if severe).

6) FAIRNESS
- Reward only items the checklist asks for. Extra but irrelevant text does not earn credit.
- Use plain, specific rationale that maps to checklist bullets hit/missed.
